# AI-Semantic-Search
Task is to implement a semantic search using artificial intelligence
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Your task is to implement a semantic search using artificial intelligence. You will develop a search engine that encodes the user's query into a vector and searches for similarity within a body of text. The user can store all the text to be searched using a vector database like Pinecone. This search engine will be designed to provide accurate and relevant search results.

Required Components

1. Vector Database: You will need to choose a vector database like Pinecone to store the text that will be searched. The vector database will be used to store and index the text documents.

2. Vectorization Algorithm: You will need to implement a vectorization algorithm that encodes the text documents into a vector representation. You can use Open AIâ€™s latest text embeddings to vectorize the search query and the text documents to be searched from.

3. Similarity Search Algorithm: You will need to implement a similarity search algorithm that can find the most similar documents to the user's query. The algorithm should be optimized for speed and accuracy.

4. User Interface: You will need to develop a user interface that allows users to enter their queries and view the search results. The interface should be intuitive and easy to use. You're welcome to use a UI template if that is easier.


Extra Features

Top candidates go above and beyond the project requirements. Specifically, we're looking for people who can engage with existing literature and implement it to optimize their search. If you need guidance on how to optimize your search, refer to the papers and repositories below.
