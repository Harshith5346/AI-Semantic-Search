# AI-Semantic-Search
Task is to implement a semantic search using artificial intelligence
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Your task is to implement a semantic search using artificial intelligence. You will develop a search engine that encodes the user's query into a vector and searches for similarity within a body of text. The user can store all the text to be searched using a vector database like Pinecone. This search engine will be designed to provide accurate and relevant search results.

Required Components

1. Vector Database: You will need to choose a vector database like Pinecone to store the text that will be searched. The vector database will be used to store and index the text documents.

2. Vectorization Algorithm: You will need to implement a vectorization algorithm that encodes the text documents into a vector representation. You can use Open AIâ€™s latest text embeddings to vectorize the search query and the text documents to be searched from.

3. Similarity Search Algorithm: You will need to implement a similarity search algorithm that can find the most similar documents to the user's query. The algorithm should be optimized for speed and accuracy.

4. User Interface: You will need to develop a user interface that allows users to enter their queries and view the search results. The interface should be intuitive and easy to use. You're welcome to use a UI template if that is easier.


To combine semantic search and GPT-3 in a project, you can follow these steps:

1. Set up the environment:
   - Install the necessary libraries, including request, BeautifulSoup, Sentence Transformer, Pinecone, and OpenAI GPT-3.
   - Obtain the required API keys for Pinecone and GPT-3.

2. Scraping and embedding:
   - Use the request library and BeautifulSoup to retrieve text content from web pages or other sources.
   - Split the text into smaller chunks (e.g., 2000 characters).
   - Use a sentence transformer model (e.g., distilbert-base-nli-stsb-mean-tokens) to convert the text chunks into embeddings.
   - Store the embeddings in the Pinecone vector database, along with metadata such as the title of the URL and other relevant information.

3. Search and retrieval:
   - Initialize the Pinecone vector database with the appropriate API key and environment.
   - When a user asks a query, calculate the embedding for the query.
   - Use Pinecone's index.query method to find the most relevant document(s) based on the query embedding.
   - Iterate through the matches and retrieve the metadata for each match, including the context or relevant information.

4. GPT-3 for answering:
   - Pass the relevant document(s) obtained from the previous step to the GPT-3 model.
   - Use GPT-3's language processing capabilities to generate accurate and informative answers to user queries.
   - Process the answer as needed (e.g., extract relevant information, format the response).

5. User interface:
   - Develop a user interface for interacting with the application.
   - Provide options for users to ask questions based on the available documents or update the database with new documents.
   - Use a suitable framework (e.g., Streamlit) to create a streamlined UI for a seamless user experience.

6. Testing and refining:
   - Test the application with various queries and documents to ensure accurate results.
   - Refine and optimize the code as necessary for improved performance.
   - Consider user feedback and incorporate enhancements to enhance usability and functionality.

Remember to handle any error cases and edge cases that may arise during the implementation process.
